Calculator to assist transferring a certain length of paper from one roll to another

How many times have you found yourself struggling to measure 40 yards of paper as you move it from one roll to another??

I split a roll of butcher paper (for brisket!!) with a friend and had this problem.  This script estimates how many times you need to turn the second roll to transfer the specified amount.
